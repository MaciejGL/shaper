## How It Works

### First Time Login

1. Click "Login with Google" on the Hypro login page
2. Choose your Google account (or sign in if needed)
3. Grant permissions for Hypro to access your basic profile (one-time consent)
4. You're automatically logged in with a pre-filled profile!

### Returning Users

1. Click "Login with Google"
2. Select your Google account (if you have multiple)
3. Instant access - no consent screen needed!

### Existing Hypro Users

If you already have a Hypro account with the same email address:

- Google login will be linked to your existing account
- Your existing profile data remains unchanged
- You can use either Google login or email/OTP to access your account

## What Data Does Hypro Access?

When you sign in with Google, Hypro requests access to:

### ‚úÖ **What We Access**

- **Basic profile**: Name, email address, profile picture
- **Locale preferences**: Your language and region settings
- **Google user ID**: A unique identifier to link your accounts

### ‚ùå **What We DON'T Access**

- Your Google password
- Gmail messages or contacts
- Google Drive files
- Search history or browsing data
- Any other Google services data

## Privacy & Control

### Your Data Rights

- **Full control**: Disconnect Google login anytime from Settings ‚Üí Account
- **Data portability**: Export your Hypro data regardless of login method
- **Account independence**: Your Hypro account works with or without Google login

### Google Privacy Controls

- **Revoke access**: Remove Hypro's access from your Google Account settings
- **Review permissions**: See exactly what data Google shares with Hypro
- **Audit activity**: Check your Google Account activity for Hypro logins

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Is Google login required?**

A: No! Google login is completely optional. You can always use email + OTP authentication.

### **Q: What happens if I disconnect Google login?**

A: Your Hypro account remains fully functional. You can continue logging in with your email address and OTP.

### **Q: Can I use both Google login and email login?**

A: Yes! Once linked, you can use either method to access the same account.

### **Q: Is my fitness data shared with Google?**

A: No. Google login is only for authentication. Your workout data, progress photos, and fitness information stay private within Hypro.

### **Q: What if I change my Google password?**

A: No action needed! Google login will continue working normally since we don't store your Google password.

### **Q: Can I use a different Google account?**

A: You can disconnect your current Google account and connect a different one, but both accounts must use the same email address as your Hypro account.

### **Q: Why does Google ask for permissions every time I log in?**

A: This shouldn't happen for returning users. If you're seeing the consent screen repeatedly, try:

- Clearing your browser cache and cookies
- Ensuring you're selecting the same Google account each time
- Checking that you haven't revoked Hypro's access in your Google Account settings
- Contact support if the issue persists

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you're using the same email address for both Google and Hypro
- Check that you've granted the necessary permissions during Google consent
- Try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito window

- Contact support if you need to change the email address associated with your account

### **Mobile App Issues**
