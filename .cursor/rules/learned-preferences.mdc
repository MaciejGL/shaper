# Learned Preferences

This file contains preferences learned from user corrections during development sessions.
The agent automatically appends new rules here when corrections don't fit other rule files.

## UI/UX

- **Prefer**: Simple confirm dialogs for destructive actions over complex modals

## Code Patterns

<!-- Preferences for code structure and organization -->

## Architecture

<!-- Preferences for system design decisions -->

## Workflow

- **Prefer**: Update `schema.prisma` only; user runs migrations manually
- **Avoid**: Creating or running Prisma migrations on behalf of the user
- **Prefer**: Set `relationLoadStrategy` explicitly (use `query` for deep includes)
- **Avoid**: Leaving deep include queries to Prisma defaults
