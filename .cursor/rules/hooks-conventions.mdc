- Hooks must be prefixed with `use` and be focused. If a hook exceeds ~200 lines or has multiple concerns, split it.
- Prefer composition over configuration-heavy hooks. Expose the minimal surface area needed.
- Reuse existing hooks (check `src/hooks`) before introducing new ones (e.g., feature flags, formatting, conversions).
- Types:
  - Export precise input/output types.
  - Accept options objects instead of positional params for readability.
- Side effects:
  - Keep side-effects isolated; return stable callbacks and memoized values when necessary.
