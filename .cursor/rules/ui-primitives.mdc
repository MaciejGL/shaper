- UI primitives in `src/components/ui` are the single source of truth. Reuse them before creating new variants.
- When extending a primitive:
  - Accept a minimal set of `props` and forward the rest.
  - Keep variants controlled via props; avoid one-off classnames in consumers.
- Tailwind rules:
  - Respect theme tokens from `globals.css` (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `ring`, `border`).
  - Prefer existing utility classes like `safe-area-*`, `hide-scrollbar`, `shadow-neuro-*`, `container(-hypertro)`.
- Don't introduce new global CSS selectors; compose utilities instead.
