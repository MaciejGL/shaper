# Meal Plan Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview

I've created a complete technical foundation for the meal plan feature with [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover) integration. The implementation follows the existing training plan patterns in your codebase and provides:

## âœ… What's Been Created

### 1. Database Schema (Complete)

- **MealPlan**: Main meal plan entity with nutritional targets
- **MealWeek**: Weekly meal organization
- **MealDay**: Daily meal structure with nutrition targets
- **Meal**: Individual meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
- **MealFood**: Planned foods in meals with nutrition data
- **MealLog**: User's actual meal consumption logs
- **MealLogItem**: Individual logged food items
- **FoodProduct**: Cached nutrition data from Open Food Facts

### 2. Open Food Facts API Integration (Complete)

- **Client**: `/src/lib/open-food-facts/client.ts`
  - Product search by name or barcode
  - Nutrition calculation with unit conversions
  - Caching system for reduced API calls
  - Meal nutrition aggregation

### 3. API Endpoints (Complete)

- **Food Search**: `/src/app/api/food/search/route.ts`
  - Search foods by name: `GET /api/food/search?q=chicken`
  - Search by barcode: `GET /api/food/search?barcode=123456789`
- **Nutrition Calculation**: `/src/app/api/food/nutrition/route.ts`
  - Calculate nutrition for meal: `POST /api/food/nutrition`
  - Single food nutrition: `GET /api/food/nutrition?barcode=123&quantity=100&unit=g`

### 4. GraphQL Schema (Complete)

- **Types**: MealPlan, MealWeek, MealDay, Meal, MealFood, MealLog, MealLogItem
- **Queries**: Templates, client plans, active plans, personal overview
- **Mutations**: Create, update, assign, activate, food logging
- **Complete CRUD operations** with granular updates

### 5. Backend Models & Factories (Complete)

- **Model Classes**: GraphQL implementation with calculated fields
- **Factory Functions**: Database operations following existing patterns
- **Resolvers**: GraphQL query/mutation handlers

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### Step 1: Database Migration

```bash
# Run Prisma migration to create tables
npx prisma db push

# Or create a proper migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_meal_plans
```

### Step 2: GraphQL Code Generation

Update `codegen.ts` to include meal plan schemas:

```typescript
const config: CodegenConfig = {
  generates: {
    'src/generated/graphql-server.ts': {
      documents: [
        // ... existing documents ...
        'src/server/models/meal-*/schema.graphql',
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run codegen
```

### Step 3: Enable Database Caching

In `src/lib/open-food-facts/client.ts`, uncomment the database caching code after migration:

```typescript
// Uncomment these lines after migration
// import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'
// Enable the getCachedProduct and cacheProduct methods
```

### Step 4: Activate GraphQL Resolvers

In `src/server/models/meal-plan/resolvers.ts`, uncomment the resolvers after codegen.

### Step 5: Register GraphQL Schema

Add to your GraphQL schema registry (likely in `src/app/api/graphql/schema.ts`):

```typescript
import { resolvers as mealPlanResolvers } from '@/server/models/meal-plan/resolvers'
import { typeDefs as mealPlanTypeDefs } from '@/server/models/meal-plan/schema.graphql'

// Add to your schema
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Implementation Plan

### Trainer Interface

#### 1. Navigation Update

Add to trainer sidebar (`src/constants/user-links.ts`):

```typescript
mealPlans: {
  href: '/trainer/meal-plans',
  label: 'Meal Plans',
  disabled: false
}
```

#### 2. Main Pages Structure

```
src/app/(protected)/trainer/meal-plans/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # List all meal plan templates
â”œâ”€â”€ creator/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ new(Button that creates new template and redirect to [mealPlanId]/page.tsx)           # Create new meal plan
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [mealPlanId]/page.tsx  # Edit existing meal plan
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ meal-plan-list.tsx      # Template list
    â”œâ”€â”€ meal-plan-card.tsx      # Template cards
    â””â”€â”€ meal-plan-creator/
        â”œâ”€â”€ meal-planner.tsx    # Main creator
        â”œâ”€â”€ nutrition-summary.tsx
        â”œâ”€â”€ food-search.tsx     # Open Food Facts search
        â””â”€â”€ food-editor.tsx     # Add/edit foods
```

#### 3. Client Management Integration

Add meal plans tab to existing client detail page:

```typescript
// In src/app/(protected)/trainer/clients/[id]/page.tsx
<TabsTrigger size="lg" value="meal-plans">
  Meal Plans
</TabsTrigger>
```

### Client Interface

#### 1. Meal Plan Viewing

```
src/app/(protected)/fitspace/meal-plans/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # My meal plans overview
â”œâ”€â”€ [planId]/page.tsx          # View specific plan
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â”œâ”€â”€ meal-tracker.tsx        # Daily meal tracking
    â”œâ”€â”€ food-logger.tsx         # Log actual consumption
    â””â”€â”€ nutrition-summary.tsx   # Progress dashboard
```

#### 2. Food Logging Features

- **Barcode Scanner**: Camera integration for easy food addition
- **Quick Log**: One-tap logging of planned foods with quantity adjustment
- **Custom Foods**: Search and add foods not in the plan
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual nutrition adherence indicators

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### Trainer Benefits

- **Nutrition Targeting**: Set daily calorie/macro targets
- **Client Assignment**: Easy meal plan distribution
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track client adherence and nutrition

### Client Benefits

- **Easy Logging**: Barcode scanning and food search
- **Flexible Portions**: Adjust quantities from planned amounts
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Real-time macro/calorie tracking
- **Plan Adherence**: Visual progress indicators

### Technical Benefits

- **Unit Conversion**: Automatic gram/cup/piece conversions
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant nutrition updates

## ðŸ“Š Usage Examples

### For Trainers

1. Create weekly meal templates with target macros
2. Add foods with accurate nutrition from Open Food Facts
3. Assign plans to clients with start dates
4. Monitor client adherence and progress

### For Clients

1. View assigned meal plans with daily targets

3. Adjust portions based on actual consumption
4. Track nutrition progress against targets

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

- **Existing Client Management**: Seamlessly integrated with trainer-client workflow
- **Notification System**: Meal plan assignments trigger notifications
- **Progress Tracking**: Similar patterns to training plan progress
- **User Permissions**: Follows existing trainer/client authorization

The implementation is ready for deployment once you complete the migration and codegen steps. The foundation provides a robust, scalable meal planning system that matches your app's architecture and UX patterns.
