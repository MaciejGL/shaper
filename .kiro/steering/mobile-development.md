# Mobile Development

## Expo/React Native Standards

- Use Expo SDK for cross-platform development
- Expo Router for navigation
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
- Use native modules when necessary

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

- Implement offline functionality where needed
- Use appropriate touch gestures
- Handle different screen sizes and orientations
- Implement proper deep linking

## Performance & Platform Integration

- Optimize bundle size and startup time
- Implement push notifications with permissions
- Use native authentication flows (biometrics)
- Monitor app performance and crashes

## Shared Code Strategy

- Share business logic between web and mobile
- Use platform-specific UI when needed
- Maintain consistent API integration
- Coordinate feature development across platforms

## Deployment

- EAS Build for compilation and distribution
- Over-the-air updates for quick fixes
- App store deployment workflows
- Performance monitoring and crash reports
