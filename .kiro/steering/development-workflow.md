- Feature branches from main
- Pull requests for code review
- Atomic commits focused on single changes

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utilities and business logic
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Code Review

- Review for quality, security, performance
- Ensure proper testing coverage
- Verify accessibility and responsive design
- Check error handling and edge cases

## Deployment

- Vercel for web deployment
- Environment variable management
- Database migrations for schema changes
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
